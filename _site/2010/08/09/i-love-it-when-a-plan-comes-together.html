  <h3>I Love It When a Plan Comes Together</h3>
<p class="meta">09 Aug 2010</p>
<p>The current plan is to meet weekly. But, since most of us lead interesting and diverse lives, we&#8217;re going to meet in person only once every other week. Current time slot is Thursdays at 7pm at McMenamin&#8217;s Old Saint Francis School. The first in person meeting is this week, Thursday, August 12. The following week, we&#8217;ll have a Skype call with all the participants that can make it. The virtual meetings are completely and totally experimental at this point, so don&#8217;t be afraid to join if you can&#8217;t make it every week.<br />
