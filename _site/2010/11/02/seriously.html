<p>Okay, meeting is on for this week. I&#8217;d claim come hell or high water, but until I get buy in from everyone via email I&#8217;m just not that confident. I just wanted to make sure the site was updated in case anyone is actually looking at this lately. (Seriously!)</p>
<p>We&#8217;re planning to meet at McMenamin&#8217;s Fireside Bar at 5:30pm on Thursday, November 4. There&#8217;s a new local ski flick debuting down the street at Summit at 7pm so we could make a night of it. We&#8217;ll cover the Introduction and Chapter 1.<br />
