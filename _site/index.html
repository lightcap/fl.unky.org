  <h3>Living Up to the Name</h3>
<p class="meta">27 Aug 2010</p>
<p>Okay, sorry everyone. I&#8217;ve dropped the ball during my two weeks of travel. Call it bad timing. Call it laziness. Call it whatever you want. So, in the interest of getting everyone onboard and caught up, let&#8217;s say we&#8217;ll meet Thursday, Septeber 9th. Let&#8217;s all try to have gotten through the first few chapters and the intro. See you all then!</p>
<p>If this is a problem for anyone let me know.<br />

<h3>Let&#8217;s Get It Started</h3>
<p class="meta">09 Aug 2010</p>
<p>Apparently this really is the world&#8217;s most pretentious book club. Look, I&#8217;ve got two reasons. First, my dear friend from college <a href="http://skitch.com/lightcap/dte27/facebook-3-matt-kern-new-book-club-forming-1st-book-godel-escher-bach-an-eternal-golden-braid-meet-each-week-alternate-skype-and-live-who-s-in">says so</a>. And second, there&#8217;s only three of us in the damn thing right now. Can you say &#8220;exclusive&#8221;?</p>
<p>So, if you want to get in on this exclusivity yourself here&#8217;s the first book we&#8217;re attacking: <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gödel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1281419903&amp;sr=8-1">G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</a></em>. And, the reason for the accusations of pretentiousness.<br />

  <h3>I Love It When a Plan Comes Together</h3>
<p class="meta">09 Aug 2010</p>
<p>The current plan is to meet weekly. But, since most of us lead interesting and diverse lives, we&#8217;re going to meet in person only once every other week. Current time slot is Thursdays at 7pm at McMenamin&#8217;s Old Saint Francis School. The first in person meeting is this week, Thursday, August 12. The following week, we&#8217;ll have a Skype call with all the participants that can make it. The virtual meetings are completely and totally experimental at this point, so don&#8217;t be afraid to join if you can&#8217;t make it every week.<br />
