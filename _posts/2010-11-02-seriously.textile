Okay, meeting is on for this week. I'd claim come hell or high water, but until I get buy in from everyone via email I'm just not that confident. I just wanted to make sure the site was updated in case anyone is actually looking at this lately. (Seriously!)

We're planning to meet at McMenamin's Fireside Bar at 5:30pm on Thursday, November 4. There's a new local ski flick debuting down the street at Summit at 7pm so we could make a night of it. We'll cover the Introduction and Chapter 1.
